Algorithm            | Time Complexity | Stability	 | Remarks
-------------------- | --------------- | ----------- | ---------
Bubble Sort          | O(n^2)          | Stable 	 |	
Selection Sort		 | O(n^2)          | Unstable 	 | Similar to bubble sort but it selects max item and sends it to last
Insertion Sort		 | O(n^2)          | Stable		 | Insert items into sorted list from unsorted
Shell Sort			 | O(n^2)		   | Unstable	 | Variation of Insertion sort
